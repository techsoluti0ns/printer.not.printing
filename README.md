Before trying to correct your printer issue in the software, verify that you are able to print outside of the software. If you cannot print outside of the software, the problem is likely the printer, not the software. If the printer won't print outside the software, verify that the printer is plugged in and powered on. Rebooting both your computer and printer may resolve the issue.
